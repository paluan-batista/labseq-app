# Labseq App


LabSeq Service is a RESTful API developed using Spring Boot that calculates values from the 'labseq' sequence. The 'labseq' sequence follows specific rules and generates values based on a given index.
## Functionality

The sequence labseq â€“ l(n) - is defined as follows:
- n=0 => l(0) = 0
- n=1 => l(1) = 1
- n=2 => l(2) = 0
- n=3 => l(3) = 1
- n>3 => l(n) = l(n-4) + l(n-3)
